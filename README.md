## Getting-Started
### Getting your data out of Excel
- [Excel vs R: when to use what](https://www.rforexcelusers.com/excel-vs-r-when-to-use-what/) - because Excel is a great tool, but another might be better.
### Plotting with R and Rstudio
- [Plotting some data in R](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/basic-tutorial.html) - make a plot!


## Formats

## Software
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - original and best.

## ELN

- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-gb/) - we get 1 Tb of free storage with our University Office365 subscription and it makes backing up to the cloud a breeze.

## Training resources
- [Periodic Table of the Open Research Ecosystem](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3263989) - this can be downloaded and adapted based on your own perspective and position in this ecosystem.
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) - a "lightly opinionated guide to reproducible data science" that can be adapted for our own use. Powerpoint slides about this resource are on [Zenodo.](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3292461)
